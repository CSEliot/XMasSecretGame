Merry Christmas to some of the best friends I could have asked for!
After nearly a week of non-stop development of this game, 
the result is a game where the only players will be you! This compiled
game exists nowhere else. Not online, even the source code has been 
deleted, and all payed for art assets locked away. This is my
christmas gift to you all, and we are going to have a lot of fucking 
fun playing it together.

Sincerely,
Eli
